# GitHub Actions Workflow Guide

This project is configured for automated deployment using GitHub Actions. Below are the steps and requirements for successful CI/CD:

## Directory Structure

- `update_requirements.py` â€” Updates dependencies (placeholder provided)
- `requirements.txt` â€” Python requirements (ensure this is up to date)
- `master_controller.py` â€” Entry point for master controller (placeholder provided)
- `main.py` â€” Entry point for agent logic (placeholder provided)
- `brotherhood-empire-final/` â€” Directory for deployable site (empty placeholder provided)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` â€” GitHub Actions workflow file

## GitHub Actions Secrets Required

Set these in your repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions:
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `ORG_ID`, `PROJECT_ID` (for Vercel deploy)
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` (for Netlify deploy)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `GHL_API_KEY`, `MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `FIREBASE_ADMIN_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for agent startup)

If a secret is missing, the corresponding step will be skipped (not fail).

## How to Deploy
- Push to the `main` branch or open a PR targeting `main`.
- The workflow will run automatically.

## Next Steps
- Replace the placeholder scripts with your actual logic.
- Add deployable content to `brotherhood-empire-final/`.
- Keep `requirements.txt` up to date.

## ðŸ“„ Documentation

This project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for documentation. Docs are published automatically to GitHub Pages on every push to `main` or `master` via the `.github/workflows/docs.yml` workflow.

- To edit documentation, modify the files in the `docs/` directory and push your changes.
- The navigation and site settings are in `mkdocs.yml`.
- The workflow installs dependencies from `requirements_docs.txt`.

**To disable documentation deployment:**
Rename or delete `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.
